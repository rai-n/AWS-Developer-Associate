### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### Overview
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions that control which AWS resources users can access. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

#### Use Cases
- Shared access to your AWS account: You can grant other people permission to administer and use resources in your AWS account without having to share your password or access key.
- Granular permissions: You can grant different permissions to different people for different resources.
- Secure access to AWS resources for applications that run on Amazon EC2: You can use IAM features to securely provide credentials for applications that run on EC2 instances. These credentials provide permissions for your application to access other AWS resources.

#### Tips
- Don't use the root user for everyday tasks: When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you don't use the root user for your everyday tasks.
- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA): You can add two-factor authentication to your account and to individual users for extra security.

For more information about IAM, you can refer to the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)


#### User Groups
An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users managed as a unit. You can use user groups to specify permissions for a collection of users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users.

#### Users
An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application. You can create IAM users and assign them individual security credentials (such as access keys or multi-factor authentication devices) or request temporary security credentials to provide users with access to AWS services and resources.

#### Roles
An IAM role is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. You can use roles to delegate access to users, applications, or services that don't normally have access to your AWS resources.

#### Policies
A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. Policies determine what actions a user, role, or member of a user group can perform, on which AWS resources, and under what conditions.

## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
 
#### Overview
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

#### Use Cases
- Hosting web applications
- Running batch processing and big data analytics workloads
- Building and testing enterprise applications
- Running high-performance computing workloads

#### Tips
- Implement the least permissive rules for your security group.
- Regularly patch, update, and secure the operating system and applications on your instance.
- Use separate Amazon EBS volumes for the operating system versus your data for data persistence. Ensure that the volume with your data persists after instance termination.
- Use instance metadata and custom resource tags to track and identify your AWS resources.
- View your current limits for Amazon EC2. Plan to request any limit increases in advance of the time that youâ€™ll need them.

#### Documentation
You can find more information about EC2 in the [official AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

#### Creating an EC2 instance 
- You can specify the hardware requirements and then launch the instance.

##### Displaying dummy data for instance
```
#!/bin/bash
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello world from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

#### Connecting to an EC2 instance using SSH

To connect to an EC2 instance from Windows 11 using OpenSSH, you need to have OpenSSH installed on your system.

Once you have OpenSSH installed, you can use the `ssh` command in PowerShell or the Command Prompt to connect to your EC2 instance. You'll need to specify the path and file name of the private key (`.pem`), the user name for your instance (e.g., `ec2-user`, `ubuntu`, etc.), and the public DNS name or IPv6 address for your instance.

Here's an example of the `ssh` command: `ssh -i "C:\Path\To\Your\Key.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-instance-public-dns`

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/openssh.html)
